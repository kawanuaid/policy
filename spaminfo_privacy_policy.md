# Privacy Policy

## Who we are
<p>Our website address is: https://spaminfo.kawanua.id.</p>

## What personal data we collect and why we collect it
### Comments and contact forms
<p>When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.</p>
<p>An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.</p>

### Cookies
<p>Please see our Cookie Policy page.</p>

### Embedded content from other websites
<p>Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.</p>
<p>These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.</p>

### Analytics
<p>As third-party technologies, we choose Google Analytics and Matomo, to collect non-personal information, when you use this online site, in the form of various usage and user metrics. These tools and technologies collect and analyze certain types of information, including demographic and interests data, cookies, IP addresses, device and software identifiers, referring and exit URLs, on-site behavior and usage information, feature use metrics and statistics, and other similar information.</p>

## Who we share your data with
<p>All personal information will be kept confidential unless disclosure is required by law (for example, to Government or law enforcement agencies). So little data is gathered we can’t see this ever happening.</p>

## How long we retain your data
<p>If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.</p>
<p>For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.</p>

## What rights you have over your data
<p>If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.</p>

## Where we send your data
<p>Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.</p>
